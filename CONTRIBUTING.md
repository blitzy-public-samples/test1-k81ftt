## Introduction

Welcome to the Task Management System project! We're building an enterprise-grade task management solution focused on security, scalability, and collaboration. Your contributions help make this project better for everyone.

### Mission Statement
Our goal is to create a robust, secure, and efficient task management platform that meets enterprise requirements while maintaining the highest standards of code quality and security.

### Code of Conduct
We are committed to providing a welcoming and professional environment. All contributors are expected to:
- Demonstrate professional conduct
- Respect diverse viewpoints
- Provide constructive feedback
- Maintain focus on technical merit
- Prioritize security in all development decisions

## Development Setup

### System Requirements

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/organization/task-management-system.git
cd task-management-system
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Configure environment variables:

```

## Development Workflow

### Git Workflow
1. Create a feature branch from `main`:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/description
```

2. Make changes following our coding standards
3. Commit using conventional commits:
```bash
feat: add task filtering capability
fix: resolve date parsing issue
docs: update API documentation
```

4. Push changes and create a pull request
